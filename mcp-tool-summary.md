## MCP Tool Auto-Configuration & Integration Summary

### 1. Objective
Provide a zero-friction path for an IDE (and eventually any MCP-aware agent) to discover and invoke a Constellation-owned MCP stdio server exposing at least one demonstrative tool (`constellation.helloWorld`). This fulfills the PRD goal: automatic project initialization + minimal viable tool handshake (initialize → tools/list → tools/call) with clean JSON-RPC 2.0 semantics.

### 2. Delivered Scope
- Auto-generation of `.vscode/mcp.json` (idempotent, guarded) on extension activation or via manual command `Constellation: Initialize Project`.
- Bundled stdio MCP server (`out/mcp-server.js`) implementing:
  - `initialize` → returns tool list and version metadata
  - `tools/list` → returns tool list (mirror of initialize result)
  - `tools/call` → executes `constellation.helloWorld` and returns a text content block
  - Robust parse / validation errors with JSON-RPC error codes (parse, method not found, invalid params, internal)
- Shared MCP types (`src/types/mcp.ts`) and constants (`src/config/constants.ts`).
- Configuration Manager (`src/config/configurationManager.ts`) handling detection, validation, idempotent writes, and logging.
- Developer diagnostics commands:
  - `Constellation: Dev Test Hello Tool` (spawn server once; initialize + call tool)
  - `Constellation: List MCP Tools` (spawn server; enumerate tools)
  - `Constellation: Call Hello Tool (MCP Client)` (internal client calling an already auto-loaded server entry)
- Internal lightweight MCP client/manager (`src/mcp/mcpClient.ts`) enabling the extension to act like an agent (discover & invoke tools directly).
- Documentation updates in `README.md` and this summary file.

| Area | File(s) | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Config Generation | `src/config/configurationManager.ts` | Validates shape & writes `.vscode/mcp.json` |
| MCP Types | `src/types/mcp.ts` | Central JSON-RPC + tool descriptor types |
| Stdio Server | `src/stdio/mcpServer.ts` | Handles initialize/list/call, one sample tool |
| Auto-Config Constants | `src/config/constants.ts` | Paths, IDs, tool descriptor |
| Client (Agent Emulation) | `src/mcp/mcpClient.ts` | Spawns server(s), caches tools, invokes calls |
| Extension Integration | `src/extension.ts` | Commands + auto-config flow + client usage |
| Build Pipeline | `esbuild.js` | Bundles extension, webview, and stdio server |
| Task Plan | `tasks/tasks-auto-config-stdio-poc.md` | Running checklist with completion marks |
| Summary | `mcp-tool-summary.md` | This report |

### 4. Current Status Snapshot
- Core handshake path validated manually (initialize → tools/call) via dev command & internal client.
- VS Code MCP provider supplies the stdio command automatically; external config not required.
- No stdout noise: server emits only line-delimited JSON.
- Remote/Codespaces compatibility: paths derived from `extensionPath` not `__dirname`.
- Lint & type checks pass for added code (no unresolved TS errors in modified files).

### 5. What Is NOT Yet Implemented
| Gap | Description | Planned Approach |
|-----|-------------|------------------|
| Chat Bridge Registration | Tools not yet registered with a chat / LLM API so they appear as inline `#` commands in a chat panel | Add a bridge module (`src/chat/mcpChatBridge.ts`) using VS Code LLM / chat tool registration API (if enabled) |
| Multi-Tool Schema | Only a single hello tool; no argument schema definitions | Extend tool descriptors with `inputSchema` & surface validation in `tools/call` |
| Streaming Support | No partial/stream responses | Add incremental output pattern (future MCP evolution) |
| Error Telemetry | Errors logged only to output channel | Optional telemetry integration (post-PoC) |
| Automated Tests (New) | Additional tests for server/client intentionally skipped per instruction | Add selective unit & integration tests later |

### 6. Verification Instructions
Manual handshake (from workspace root):
```bash
node out/mcp-server.js <<'EOF'
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize"}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"constellation.helloWorld"}}
EOF
```
Expect two JSON responses (ids 1 & 2) – second contains `content` array with a text block.

Internal client usage (after activation):
1. Command Palette → `Constellation: Call Hello Tool (MCP Client)`
2. Notification shows tool result; output channel logs full JSON result.

### 7. Architectural Notes
- Separation of responsibilities:
  - Generation (ConfigurationManager) vs Execution (Stdio Server) vs Consumption (MCPClientManager) keeps future multi-server support easy.
- Each stdio server process is short-lived in diagnostic commands; internal client maintains persistent processes.
- Potential future optimization: reuse the same spawned process across both diagnostic & client commands (pooling) with reference counting.

### 8. Security / Safety Considerations
- Config file only points to a local bundled script (no user-provided arbitrary command injection).
- Stdio server rejects malformed JSON (parse error) and unknown methods (method not found code).
- Tool names constrained; unrecognized tool invocation returns `METHOD_NOT_FOUND`.

### 9. Performance Considerations
- One-off spawn for diagnostic commands is negligible overhead.
- Persistent client processes scale linearly with number of configured stdio servers (currently one). Future optimization: multiplex tool calls if a single process advertises many tools.

### 10. Recommended Next Steps
| Priority | Action | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| High | Implement chat bridge tool registration | Surface tools inside chat UI to meet UX parity goal |
| High | Add friendly alias (e.g. `#hello`) | Better discoverability and shorter chat invocation |
| Medium | Add argument schema example tool | Showcase structured inputs & validation |
| Medium | Add minimal tests for MCP client lifecycle | Guard against regressions when adding more tools |
| Low | Introduce structured logging / telemetry | Observability for production contexts |
| Low | Streaming support experiment | Future-proof for long-running tools |

### 11. Stretch Ideas
- Dynamic tool hot-reload: watch changes to tool registry file and re-send an `initialize`-like refresh through bridge.
- Capability negotiation: enrich `initialize` response with feature flags.
- Tool marketplace view: render discovered tools in a dedicated webview panel with per-tool test buttons.

### 12. Conclusion
Core PRD objective (auto-config + minimal MCP stdio tool invocation) is achieved. Remaining gap to match the user-visible experience of other MCP-integrated chat tools is the chat bridge registration. Implementation is straightforward given the existing `MCPClientManager`—estimated < 150 lines additional TypeScript including error handling and documentation.
