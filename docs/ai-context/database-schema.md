## Purpose of This Document

Document any application-level persistent database schema (tables, collections, entities) if present.

## Current State

This project does **not** define or interact with an external database (SQL, NoSQL, ORM schemas) within the repository.

## Persistence Mechanisms In Use

- File-based caching for graph data (`.constellation-cache/graph-v1.json`).
- In-memory caches (metrics, health analysis, reverse dependency index).
- No relational / document schema entities, migrations, or ORM models detected.

## Implications

- All analysis is ephemeral aside from lightweight graph cache files.
- Introducing multi-session / historical analytics would require adding a persistence layer (e.g., SQLite, embedded document store, or cloud service).

## Future Considerations

- Add optional SQLite layer for longitudinal trend analysis (complexity & churn over time).
- Persist impact analysis history for regression tracking.
