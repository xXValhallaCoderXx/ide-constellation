# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Kiro Constellation Sidebar Refresh feature aims to modernize the sidebar interface to match the new design while maintaining full VS Code theme compatibility. This feature will establish an atomic design system with reusable components, implement a styled tab navigation system, and create a structured Quick Access section using existing functionality. The refresh focuses on visual improvements and component architecture without changing core business logic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a VS Code user, I want a visually cohesive sidebar that matches VS Code's native design language, so that the extension feels integrated and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar is displayed THEN the extension SHALL use only VS Code CSS variables for all colors, backgrounds, and borders
2. WHEN switching between VS Code themes (Dark+, Light+, High Contrast) THEN the sidebar SHALL automatically adapt without any hardcoded colors
3. WHEN viewing the sidebar THEN all typography SHALL inherit from VS Code font settings and scale appropriately with zoom levels
4. WHEN interacting with any element THEN focus indicators SHALL use `--vscode-focusBorder` for consistency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user navigating the extension, I want clear tab-based navigation with visual feedback, so that I can easily understand which section I'm viewing and switch between them efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar loads THEN the system SHALL display four tabs: Home, Graph, Health, and Actions
2. WHEN a tab is active THEN the system SHALL display a visible pill-style background using VS Code theme colors
3. WHEN clicking on a tab THEN the system SHALL switch to that panel and update the active state immediately
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support arrow keys to move between tabs and Enter/Space to activate
5. WHEN focusing on tabs THEN the system SHALL provide clear focus indicators that meet accessibility standards
6. WHEN hovering over inactive tabs THEN the system SHALL show subtle hover feedback using `--vscode-toolbar-hoverBackground`

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user looking for quick actions, I want a well-organized Quick Access section that presents existing functionality in a clean layout, so that I can efficiently access common features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Home tab THEN the system SHALL display a "Quick Access" section with a clear section title
2. WHEN the Quick Access section loads THEN the system SHALL show existing buttons (Open Dependency Graph, Open Health Dashboard, Extension Settings) in a vertical stack
3. WHEN buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain their current functionality while fitting the new visual design
4. WHEN hovering over Quick Access buttons THEN the system SHALL provide subtle background feedback using `--vscode-list-hoverBackground`
5. WHEN viewing Quick Access buttons THEN they SHALL have consistent width and spacing within their container

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a placeholder for recent graph sessions, so that I understand this functionality will be available in the future without it being incomplete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Home tab THEN the system SHALL display a "Recent graph sessions" section header
2. WHEN the Recent Sessions section loads THEN the system SHALL show a disabled "View All" link to indicate future functionality
3. WHEN viewing the Recent Sessions area THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent spacing and not cause layout shifts
4. WHEN the section is empty THEN the system SHALL use a minimum height placeholder to preserve layout stability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working on the extension, I want a well-structured atomic design system, so that I can efficiently build and maintain UI components across different features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating components THEN the system SHALL organize them into atoms, molecules, organisms, and templates following atomic design principles
2. WHEN building atoms THEN they SHALL be purely presentational with props for customization and no business logic
3. WHEN creating molecules THEN they SHALL compose atoms and expose minimal, focused props
4. WHEN implementing organisms THEN they SHALL handle layout concerns and coordinate multiple molecules
5. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL be reusable across different features (Graph, Health, Actions)
6. WHEN styling components THEN they SHALL use CSS custom properties for spacing, radii, and other design tokens

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the sidebar to be fully accessible via keyboard and screen readers, so that I can use the extension effectively regardless of my interaction method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be reachable via Tab key
2. WHEN navigating tabs with keyboard THEN the system SHALL support roving tabindex with arrow keys, Home, and End
3. WHEN using a screen reader THEN all elements SHALL have appropriate ARIA roles and labels
4. WHEN tabs are focused THEN they SHALL announce their state (active/inactive) to assistive technology
5. WHEN buttons are focused THEN they SHALL provide clear accessible names and descriptions
6. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN all visual elements SHALL remain clearly distinguishable

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sidebar to perform smoothly without lag or visual glitches, so that my workflow remains uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the transition SHALL complete in under 2ms with no layout shifts
2. WHEN the sidebar loads THEN the initial render SHALL not cause cumulative layout shift (CLS)
3. WHEN hovering over elements THEN hover states SHALL respond immediately without delay
4. WHEN resizing the VS Code window THEN the sidebar SHALL maintain proper proportions and spacing
5. WHEN multiple theme changes occur THEN the sidebar SHALL update smoothly without flickering
