# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a robust, standalone analysis engine that can scan a user's workspace using `dependency-cruiser` to generate a structured JSON object representing the file dependency graph. The engine will be encapsulated in a dedicated module with proper error handling and testing capabilities to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a dependency analysis engine that can scan my workspace, so that I can understand the file dependency relationships in my project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis engine is invoked with a workspace path THEN the system SHALL return a structured JSON object representing the file dependency graph
2. WHEN the analysis encounters syntax errors or parsing issues THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and return a valid empty graph object
3. WHEN the analysis is performed on an empty directory THEN the system SHALL return a valid empty graph object without crashing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the analysis engine to be resilient to errors, so that my extension doesn't crash when encountering problematic code or directories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs during dependency analysis THEN the system SHALL log the error for debugging purposes
2. WHEN any error occurs during dependency analysis THEN the system SHALL return a predictable, safe fallback value
3. WHEN the dependency-cruiser library throws an exception THEN the system SHALL catch it and prevent application crashes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to test the analysis engine in isolation, so that I can verify its functionality before integrating it into the main extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test script is executed THEN the system SHALL demonstrate the analyzer working with sample project files
2. WHEN the test script runs THEN the system SHALL output the dependency graph JSON to the console for verification
3. WHEN sample files with import relationships are analyzed THEN the system SHALL correctly identify and represent those relationships in the output

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the analysis engine to be properly modularized, so that it can be easily maintained and integrated into different parts of the extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analyzer module is created THEN the system SHALL export a single asynchronous function called `generateDependencyGraph`
2. WHEN the function is called THEN the system SHALL accept a workspace path as a parameter
3. WHEN the module is imported THEN the system SHALL provide a clean, well-defined API interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the necessary dependencies to be properly managed, so that the analysis functionality is available and the project remains maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is set up THEN the system SHALL include `dependency-cruiser` as a production dependency
2. WHEN development tooling is needed THEN the system SHALL include `ts-node` as a development dependency
3. WHEN package scripts are defined THEN the system SHALL include a test script for running the analyzer in isolation
