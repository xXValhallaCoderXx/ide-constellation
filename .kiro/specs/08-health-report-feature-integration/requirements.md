# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Health Report Feature Integration transforms the existing Health Analysis Dashboard into a comprehensive dual-view system that combines analytical insights with visual intelligence. This feature integrates the completed Risk Analysis Engine with graph heatmap visualization to provide both statistical insights (dashboard) and visual patterns (heatmap), creating multiple "wow" moments for users. The core value is transforming invisible technical debt into both statistical insights AND visual patterns, providing a strategic advantage over competitors who typically show only one view.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: MCP Tool Enhancement for Dual-View Data

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use "@constellation health report" command so that I can receive comprehensive analysis data in both dashboard and graph visualization formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types "@constellation health report" THEN the system SHALL return structured data containing summary narrative, dashboard data, and visual instruction payload
2. WHEN the MCP tool processes a health report request THEN it SHALL generate heatmap data with node IDs, risk scores, colors, and metrics for graph overlay
3. WHEN the tool completes analysis THEN it SHALL send visual instructions to the webview for dual-view rendering
4. IF the extension context is available THEN the system SHALL automatically send visual instructions to the webview without additional user action

### Requirement 2: Dashboard Integration with Graph Visualization Trigger

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to click "View Heatmap on Graph" from the dashboard so that I can see the same risk data visualized on the graph canvas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health dashboard is displayed THEN it SHALL include a "View Heatmap on Graph" button in the dashboard actions section
2. WHEN a user clicks the "View Heatmap on Graph" button THEN the system SHALL open the graph panel if not already visible
3. WHEN transitioning to graph view THEN the system SHALL apply heatmap overlay with risk colors within 500ms
4. WHEN displaying risk files in the dashboard THEN each file SHALL be clickable and navigate to the corresponding node in the graph
5. WHEN a user clicks a risk file in the dashboard THEN the system SHALL highlight the corresponding node in the graph and open the file in the editor

### Requirement 3: Graph Heatmap Overlay Visualization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see risk analysis as a color-coded heatmap on the graph so that I can visually identify problem areas in my codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN heatmap overlay is applied THEN nodes SHALL animate to risk-appropriate colors with 300ms smooth transitions
2. WHEN a node has high risk (score > 0.7) THEN it SHALL display with increased border width and critical color styling
3. WHEN heatmap is active THEN nodes SHALL store risk data for tooltip display on hover
4. WHEN a user hovers over a risk node THEN the system SHALL display enhanced tooltip with risk score, category, complexity metrics, and churn data
5. WHEN heatmap overlay is cleared THEN all nodes SHALL animate back to original styling within 300ms
6. WHEN heatmap is active THEN a floating legend SHALL appear automatically showing risk scale and interaction instructions

### Requirement 4: Bidirectional Navigation Between Views

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless navigation between dashboard and graph views so that I can analyze risks from both statistical and visual perspectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a file in the dashboard risk list THEN the system SHALL open the file in the editor with configurable open mode (default or split)
2. WHEN navigating from dashboard to graph THEN the system SHALL center and highlight the selected node in the graph view
3. WHEN a user clicks a node in the heatmap THEN the system SHALL highlight the corresponding risk in the dashboard list
4. WHEN clicking nodes in graph view THEN the system SHALL support modifier keys (Ctrl/Cmd) for split-pane editor opening
5. WHEN switching between views THEN both dashboard and graph SHALL remain synchronized showing the same risk analysis data

### Requirement 5: Command Palette Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want multiple entry points through VS Code commands so that I can access health reporting features efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "constellation.healthReport" command is executed THEN the system SHALL display the dashboard view first
2. WHEN "constellation.healthReportGraph" command is executed THEN the system SHALL display the graph with heatmap overlay directly
3. WHEN "constellation.clearHeatmap" command is executed THEN the system SHALL remove heatmap overlay and restore original graph styling
4. WHEN any health report command is executed THEN the system SHALL handle cases where analysis data is not yet available

### Requirement 6: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want smooth and responsive interactions so that the health reporting feature feels integrated and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN heatmap overlay is applied THEN it SHALL render within 500ms of user action
2. WHEN color transitions occur THEN they SHALL maintain 60 FPS performance during animation
3. WHEN switching between dashboard and graph views THEN transitions SHALL be smooth without lag or blocking
4. WHEN tooltips are displayed THEN they SHALL appear immediately on hover without delay
5. WHEN the feature is used in both light and dark themes THEN colors and styling SHALL work appropriately in both modes

### Requirement 7: Visual Polish and Feedback

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear visual feedback and polished interactions so that the feature feels professional and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interactive elements are hovered THEN they SHALL provide clear visual feedback with appropriate hover states
2. WHEN heatmap legend is displayed THEN it SHALL include toggle functionality to show/hide heatmap overlay
3. WHEN risk nodes are displayed THEN higher risk nodes SHALL have higher z-index for proper visual hierarchy
4. WHEN animations occur THEN they SHALL use appropriate easing functions for smooth, natural motion
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking the user interface
