    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

  - [x] 3.2 Add public scan method to MCP server
    - Create public scanProject method that can be called directly from extension
    - Connect method to worker thread execution
    - Return promise that resolves when scan completes
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 4. Add VS Code command integration
  - [x] 4.1 Register constellation.scanProject command
    - Add command definition to package.json contributes.commands
    - Update command title to "Constellation: Scan Project"
    - _Requirements: 1.1_

  - [x] 4.2 Implement command handler in extension.ts
    - Add command registration in activate function
    - Implement command handler that directly calls MCP server scanProject method
    - Add proper error handling and user feedback
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 5. Implement comprehensive logging and status reporting
  - [x] 5.1 Add worker thread status logging
    - Implement status message logging in MCP server
    - Add timestamp formatting for all log messages
    - Ensure all messages go to "Kiro Constellation" output channel
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.6_

  - [x] 5.2 Add raw JSON result logging
    - Implement complete dependency-cruiser output logging
    - Format JSON output for readability in output channel
    - Add clear status indicators for scan completion
    - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6_

- [x] 6. Update build system for worker thread compilation
  - [x] 6.1 Configure esbuild for worker thread compilation
    - Update esbuild.js to compile worker files separately
    - Ensure worker threads are built to correct output directory
    - Verify worker thread paths are resolved correctly at runtime
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 7. Manual testing and validation
  - [x] 7.1 Test basic scan functionality
    - Execute constellation.scanProject command from Command Palette
    - Verify scan starts without blocking VS Code interface
    - Confirm "Scan starting" message appears in output channel
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.3, 4.1_

  - [ ] 7.2 Validate scan results and logging
    - Verify "Scan complete" message appears in output channel
    - Confirm raw JSON output from dependency-cruiser is logged
    - Check that output includes timestamp and status indicators
    - Test with different project structures and sizes
    - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6_

  - [ ] 7.3 Test error handling scenarios
    - Test scan with invalid target paths
    - Verify error messages are properly logged
    - Confirm VS Code remains responsive during error conditions
    - Test worker thread cleanup after errors
    - _Requirements: 2.5, 4.3_
