# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will make the architecture map "live" by automatically triggering the dependency analysis engine when files are saved and establishing a robust data pipeline to send the resulting dependency graph from the extension's backend to the webview frontend. The system will include performance optimizations to handle rapid file saves efficiently while maintaining real-time updates to the visualization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the architecture map to automatically update when I save files, so that I can see real-time changes to my project's dependency structure without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is saved in the workspace THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger the dependency analysis engine
2. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL send the updated dependency graph to the webview
3. WHEN no workspace folder is open THEN the system SHALL handle this gracefully without errors
4. WHEN the webview is not open THEN the system SHALL not attempt to send data to prevent errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working on large projects, I want the system to handle rapid file saves efficiently, so that my IDE remains responsive during intensive coding sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple files are saved in rapid succession THEN the system SHALL debounce the analysis triggers to prevent performance issues
2. WHEN the debounce period is active THEN the system SHALL wait 500ms after the last save before triggering analysis
3. WHEN rapid saves occur THEN the system SHALL only execute one analysis operation per debounce period
4. WHEN the analysis is debounced THEN the system SHALL still provide the most up-to-date dependency graph

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the updated architecture map in the webview immediately after saving files, so that I can understand the impact of my changes in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dependency analysis completes THEN the system SHALL send the graph data to the webview via postMessage
2. WHEN the webview receives graph data THEN it SHALL log the receipt for debugging purposes
3. WHEN the message is sent THEN it SHALL include a command identifier and the complete graph data
4. WHEN the webview is disposed THEN the system SHALL clean up references to prevent memory leaks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide clear feedback about the analysis process, so that I can understand when updates are happening and troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file save triggers analysis THEN the system SHALL log the workspace path being analyzed
2. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL log confirmation with graph data summary
3. WHEN the webview receives data THEN it SHALL log the received message for debugging
4. WHEN errors occur during analysis THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to maintain proper state management for the webview panel, so that the data pipeline works reliably across different usage scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a webview panel is created THEN the system SHALL store a reference to enable data transmission
2. WHEN the webview panel is disposed THEN the system SHALL clear the stored reference
3. WHEN attempting to send data THEN the system SHALL verify the webview panel exists before sending
4. WHEN multiple webview panels could exist THEN the system SHALL handle this scenario appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to integrate seamlessly with the existing dependency analysis functionality, so that I can leverage the current analysis capabilities without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN triggering automatic analysis THEN the system SHALL use the existing generateDependencyGraph function
2. WHEN analysis is triggered THEN the system SHALL pass the correct workspace root path
3. WHEN the analysis function returns data THEN the system SHALL handle the response format correctly
4. WHEN integrating with existing code THEN the system SHALL not break current manual analysis functionality
