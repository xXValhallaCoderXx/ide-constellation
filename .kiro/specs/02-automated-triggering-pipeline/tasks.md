 # Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up basic file save event listener
  - Register VS Code workspace.onDidSaveTextDocument event listener in extension.ts activate function
  - Implement workspace folder validation to handle cases where no folder is open
  - Add console logging to verify event detection is working correctly
  - Test with manual file saves to confirm event registration
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Integrate existing analysis engine with save events
  - Import generateDependencyGraph function from analyzer module in extension.ts
  - Call analysis function when file save event is detected
  - Pass correct workspace root path to analysis function
  - Add console logging to display analysis results for debugging
  - Handle analysis errors gracefully without breaking extension
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 3. Enhance WebviewManager for state management
  - Add module-level variable to store active webview panel reference
  - Modify createOrShowPanel method to store panel reference when created
  - Implement onDidDispose handler to clear panel reference when webview is closed
  - Add method to safely check if webview panel exists and is active
  - Create method to send messages to webview with existence validation
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 4. Implement data pipeline from extension to webview
  - Create structured message format with command and data fields
  - Implement message sending logic in extension.ts after analysis completes
  - Add webview panel existence check before attempting to send messages
  - Include metadata like timestamp and module count in messages
  - Add error handling for message transmission failures
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3, 4.2_

- [ ] 5. Add webview message receiver functionality
  - Enhance webview.ts to listen for messages from extension
  - Implement message handler that processes updateGraph commands
  - Add message validation to ensure proper structure
  - Include console logging to verify message receipt for debugging
  - Handle different message types with switch statement structure
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 6. Add Lodash dependency for debouncing
  - Install lodash package using npm install lodash
  - Install TypeScript types with npm install --save-dev @types/lodash
  - Update package.json to include lodash in dependencies
  - Verify installation by importing debounce function in extension.ts
  - _Requirements: 2.1_

- [ ] 7. Implement debounced analysis trigger
  - Import debounce function from lodash in extension.ts
  - Create debounced function that wraps analysis and message sending logic
  - Set debounce delay to 500ms as specified in requirements
  - Ensure debounced function is created only once during extension activation
  - Replace direct analysis call with debounced function call in save event handler
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 8. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Implement try-catch blocks around all analysis and messaging operations
  - Add structured logging for workspace validation, analysis start, and completion
  - Create error message format for sending analysis failures to webview
  - Add logging for debounce trigger events and timing
  - Implement graceful handling of webview disposal during analysis
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.4, 1.4_

- [ ] 9. Create unit tests for file save event handling
  - Write tests for workspace validation logic using mocked VS Code API
  - Test event listener registration and cleanup functionality
  - Verify proper handling of missing workspace folder scenarios
  - Test integration with analysis engine function calls
  - Mock generateDependencyGraph function to isolate event handling logic
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 6.1_

- [ ] 10. Create unit tests for debounced trigger functionality
  - Test debounce timing accuracy with controlled save event simulation
  - Verify single analysis execution per debounce period
  - Test debounce cancellation behavior when extension is deactivated
  - Mock analysis function to measure debounce effectiveness
  - Test rapid save scenarios to ensure performance optimization
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 11. Create integration tests for data pipeline
  - Test complete flow from file save event to webview message receipt
  - Mock webview panel interface to verify message transmission
  - Test message format and structure validation
  - Verify error handling when webview panel is disposed
  - Test pipeline performance under various analysis result sizes
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 5.3_

- [ ] 12. Add performance monitoring and optimization
  - Implement timing measurements for analysis operations
  - Add memory usage monitoring during extended analysis sessions
  - Create performance logging for debounce effectiveness metrics
  - Optimize message payload size for large dependency graphs
  - Add performance benchmarks for different project sizes
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 4.1_
