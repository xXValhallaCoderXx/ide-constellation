# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a file-save event listener system for the VS Code extension that captures document save events and applies intelligent filtering to trigger Polaris functionality only for relevant file types and paths. The system will monitor workspace file saves, filter based on file type and location criteria, and provide appropriate logging for verification and debugging purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want the system to automatically detect when I save relevant code files, so that Polaris can be triggered for appropriate files without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user saves any text document in the workspace THEN the system SHALL capture the save event
2. WHEN a save event is captured THEN the system SHALL apply filtering logic before processing
3. WHEN filtering determines a file is relevant THEN the system SHALL trigger Polaris functionality
4. WHEN filtering determines a file is not relevant THEN the system SHALL ignore the save event

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to only process JavaScript and TypeScript files, so that irrelevant file saves don't trigger unnecessary processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a .ts file is saved THEN the system SHALL process the save event
2. WHEN a .js file is saved THEN the system SHALL process the save event
3. WHEN a .tsx file is saved THEN the system SHALL process the save event
4. WHEN a .jsx file is saved THEN the system SHALL process the save event
5. WHEN a file with any other extension is saved THEN the system SHALL ignore the save event
6. WHEN a package.json file is saved THEN the system SHALL ignore the save event

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to ignore files in certain directories like node_modules and .constellation, so that dependency and configuration file changes don't trigger processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file inside node_modules directory is saved THEN the system SHALL ignore the save event
2. WHEN a file inside .constellation directory is saved THEN the system SHALL ignore the save event
3. WHEN a relevant file type is saved outside excluded directories THEN the system SHALL process the save event
4. IF a file path contains /node_modules/ anywhere in the path THEN the system SHALL ignore the save event
5. IF a file path contains /.constellation/ anywhere in the path THEN the system SHALL ignore the save event

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer testing the extension, I want to see debug output when files are processed, so that I can verify the filtering logic is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a relevant file is saved and processed THEN the system SHALL log the file content to the Debug Console
2. WHEN an irrelevant file is saved THEN the system SHALL NOT log anything to the Debug Console
3. WHEN logging occurs THEN the log message SHALL include the file path for identification
4. WHEN logging occurs THEN the log message SHALL include the file content for verification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the event listener to be properly registered and disposed of with the extension lifecycle, so that there are no memory leaks or orphaned listeners.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is activated THEN the file save listener SHALL be registered
2. WHEN the extension is deactivated THEN the file save listener SHALL be properly disposed
3. WHEN the listener is registered THEN it SHALL be added to the extension context subscriptions
4. IF the extension is reloaded THEN the previous listener SHALL be cleaned up automatically
