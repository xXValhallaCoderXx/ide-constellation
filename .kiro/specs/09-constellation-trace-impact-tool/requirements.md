# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The constellation_trace_impact tool transforms Kiro Constellation from a passive visualization into an intelligent impact analysis system. This MCP tool enables developers to understand the "blast radius" of changes before making them, answering the critical question: "What breaks if I change this?" The tool provides AI-accessible impact analysis with visual feedback, risk scoring, and actionable safeguards for any proposed code change.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ask Kiro "what happens if I refactor auth.service.ts?" so that I can understand the impact before making changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user queries about modifying a specific file THEN the system SHALL analyze the dependency graph and return impact information
2. WHEN the analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL complete the analysis within 2 seconds
3. WHEN the results are returned THEN the system SHALL provide both text summary for AI consumption and structured data for visual rendering

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see which files will break immediately so that I can focus my testing efforts on critical areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN impact analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL categorize affected files by impact level (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
2. WHEN files have CRITICAL impact THEN the system SHALL identify them as "will break immediately"
3. WHEN multiple impact levels exist THEN the system SHALL present them in order of severity (CRITICAL first)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to get a visual "ripple effect" in the graph so that I can intuitively understand the change propagation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN impact analysis completes THEN the system SHALL send animation commands to the graph panel
2. WHEN the animation plays THEN the system SHALL show expanding circles starting from the target node
3. WHEN nodes are animated THEN the system SHALL color-code them by impact level (Critical: Red, High: Orange, Medium: Yellow, Low: Green)
4. WHEN the animation sequence runs THEN the system SHALL expand to direct dependencies at 100ms, secondary at 200ms, and tertiary at 300ms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive a risk score (0-10) so that I can make informed decisions about change timing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN impact analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL calculate a risk score from 0-10
2. WHEN calculating risk score THEN the system SHALL use direct impacts (100 points each), secondary impacts (50 points each), and tertiary impacts (25 points each)
3. WHEN the total points are calculated THEN the system SHALL normalize to 0-10 scale using Math.min(10, totalPoints / 100)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to get specific safeguard recommendations so that I can minimize production incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN risk score is greater than 7 THEN the system SHALL recommend "Consider feature flag deployment"
2. WHEN risk score is greater than 5 THEN the system SHALL recommend "Write integration tests first"
3. WHEN circular dependency is detected THEN the system SHALL recommend "Resolve circular dependency before refactoring"
4. WHEN more than 10 files are affected THEN the system SHALL recommend "Consider breaking into smaller changes"
5. WHEN test recommendations are provided THEN the system SHALL list the top 3 files that need test coverage prioritized by impact level

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to be accessible through MCP so that I can use it through AI assistants like Kiro.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN the system SHALL register the constellation_trace_impact tool
2. WHEN the tool is queried THEN the system SHALL accept target (file path), changeType ('refactor' | 'delete' | 'modify' | 'add-feature'), and optional depth (default: 3, max: 5) parameters
3. WHEN the tool is called THEN the system SHALL return a structured markdown response with impact analysis, risk score, and recommendations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the analysis to handle complex dependency scenarios so that I get accurate impact assessment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN traversing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use the existing GraphService for graph data
2. WHEN circular dependencies are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully by stopping at the first cycle
3. WHEN the specified depth is reached THEN the system SHALL stop traversal to prevent performance issues
4. WHEN transitive dependencies are analyzed THEN the system SHALL track up to the specified depth level

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a demo presenter, I want to show judges how Kiro prevents disasters so that I can demonstrate unique value beyond code generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demonstrating the tool THEN the system SHALL provide a clear "wow moment" showing dramatic impact visualization
2. WHEN the analysis completes THEN the system SHALL format results in an easily understandable markdown structure with emojis and clear sections
3. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL include pro tips and actionable insights that demonstrate intelligence beyond basic dependency tracking
