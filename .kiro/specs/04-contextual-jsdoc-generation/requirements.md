# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables contextual JSDoc generation by leveraging the existing LLMService to analyze TypeScript code snippets and generate high-quality, accurate JSDoc comments. The system will use a carefully crafted prompt to instruct an AI technical writer to produce comprehensive documentation that includes function descriptions, parameter details, and return value information. A temporary debug command will be implemented to validate the end-to-end functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate JSDoc comments for TypeScript functions using AI, so that I can quickly create comprehensive documentation without manually writing boilerplate comments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a code snippet is provided to the generateDocstring method THEN the system SHALL wrap it in a structured AI technical writer prompt
2. WHEN the prompt is sent to the OpenRouter API THEN the system SHALL receive a properly formatted JSDoc comment in response
3. WHEN the JSDoc is generated THEN it SHALL include function description, parameter documentation with types, and return value documentation
4. WHEN the response is received THEN the system SHALL return only the JSDoc block without including the original code

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the JSDoc generation functionality through a debug command, so that I can verify the feature works correctly before integrating it into the main workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the constellation.testDocstringGeneration command is executed THEN the system SHALL call the generateDocstring method with a predefined test function
2. WHEN the test function is processed THEN it SHALL be a non-trivial, multi-line TypeScript function without existing documentation
3. WHEN the command completes THEN the system SHALL log the generated JSDoc comment to the Debug Console
4. WHEN the test runs THEN it SHALL demonstrate the complete end-to-end functionality from code input to JSDoc output

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the JSDoc generation to integrate seamlessly with the existing LLMService, so that we maintain consistency with our current API interaction patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the generateDocstring method THEN it SHALL be added as a public method to the existing LLMService class
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use the same OpenRouter API integration pattern as the existing testConnection method
3. WHEN processing responses THEN the system SHALL parse the API response using the same error handling and response extraction logic
4. WHEN the method is called THEN it SHALL return a Promise<string> containing the generated JSDoc comment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a technical writer, I want the AI prompt to be specifically designed for JSDoc generation, so that the output follows JSDoc conventions and provides comprehensive documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN constructing the prompt THEN the system SHALL include instructions for the AI to act as an expert technical writer
2. WHEN the prompt is created THEN it SHALL specify requirements for function purpose description, parameter documentation with @param tags, and return value documentation with @returns tags
3. WHEN sending the prompt THEN it SHALL explicitly instruct the AI to respond with only the JSDoc block
4. WHEN the code snippet is included THEN it SHALL be properly formatted within TypeScript code blocks in the prompt
