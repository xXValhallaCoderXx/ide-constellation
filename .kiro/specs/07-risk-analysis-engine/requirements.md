# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Risk Analysis Engine is a high-performance, local computation system that calculates health metrics for every file in the codebase. This engine serves as the computational backend for all health-related features in the Kiro Constellation extension, providing instant, deterministic risk scores without external dependencies. The system analyzes code complexity, git churn patterns, and dependency relationships to generate unified health assessments that help developers identify problematic areas in their codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to analyze code complexity metrics for all files, so that I can identify overly complex files that may need refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes a TypeScript file THEN it SHALL calculate lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, and file size metrics
2. WHEN the system analyzes a JavaScript file THEN it SHALL calculate lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, and file size metrics  
3. WHEN the system encounters an unsupported file type THEN it SHALL calculate basic metrics (lines of code and file size only)
4. WHEN complexity analysis is requested for a file THEN the system SHALL complete the analysis within 100ms per file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to analyze git history and churn patterns, so that I can identify files that change frequently and may indicate instability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes git history THEN it SHALL calculate commit count for the last 30 days
2. WHEN the system analyzes git history THEN it SHALL identify unique authors who modified the file in the last 30 days
3. WHEN the system analyzes git history THEN it SHALL determine the last modified date and days since last change
4. WHEN a file has no git history THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with default values
5. WHEN git analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL complete within 200ms per file

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to combine multiple metrics into unified risk scores, so that I can get a single health assessment for each file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating risk scores THEN the system SHALL use percentile-based normalization across all files
2. WHEN calculating risk scores THEN the system SHALL weight complexity at 40%, churn at 40%, and dependencies at 20%
3. WHEN calculating risk scores THEN the system SHALL categorize files as low, medium, high, or critical risk
4. WHEN calculating risk scores THEN the system SHALL assign appropriate colors for visualization (green to red gradient)
5. WHEN risk scores are calculated THEN they SHALL be deterministic and reproducible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to cache analysis results, so that subsequent loads are instant and don't impact my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complexity metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL cache results for 1 week
2. WHEN churn metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL cache results for 1 day  
3. WHEN full health analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL cache results for 1 hour
4. WHEN cached data is requested THEN the system SHALL return results within 50ms
5. WHEN cached data expires THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate and update the cache

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to generate actionable recommendations, so that I can understand what actions to take to improve codebase health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL identify hotspot files with high complexity and frequent changes
2. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate at least 1 actionable recommendation
3. WHEN hotspots are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest specific refactoring actions
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide interesting statistics about the codebase
5. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN they SHALL include specific file names and metrics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to perform efficiently at scale, so that it doesn't slow down my development workflow even on large codebases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing 1,500 files THEN the system SHALL complete initial analysis within 2 seconds
2. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL use parallel processing with batch sizes of 50 files
3. WHEN running analysis THEN the system SHALL keep memory usage under 100MB
4. WHEN subsequent analysis is requested THEN cached results SHALL load within 500ms
5. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the analysis SHALL degrade gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide comprehensive health analysis data, so that I can understand the overall state of my codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide an overall health score from 0-100
2. WHEN health analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL show distribution of files across risk categories
3. WHEN health analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL identify the top 5 highest risk files
4. WHEN health analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL include timestamp and total file count
5. WHEN health analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve raw metrics for detailed tooltips and drill-down
