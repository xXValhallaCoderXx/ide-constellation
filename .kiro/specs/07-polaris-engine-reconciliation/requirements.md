# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Polaris Engine Reconciliation feature addresses critical data integrity issues in the current vector store implementation. Currently, the system uses a simple "upsert-only" strategy that cannot handle function modifications, renames, or deletions, leading to orphaned records and data inconsistencies. This feature will implement a robust reconciliation workflow that ensures perfect synchronization between the source code state and the vector database on every file save.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Kiro Constellation, I want the vector store to accurately reflect my current codebase state, so that semantic searches return only relevant and up-to-date results without orphaned entries from deleted or renamed functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function is deleted from a file THEN the system SHALL remove the corresponding vector store record
2. WHEN a function is renamed in a file THEN the system SHALL delete the old record and create a new record with the updated name
3. WHEN a function's content is modified THEN the system SHALL update the existing record with new embeddings
4. WHEN a file is saved THEN the system SHALL ensure the vector store contains exactly the symbols present in the current file state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the vector store schema to support efficient file-based queries, so that the system can quickly identify and manage all records belonging to a specific file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the vector store is initialized THEN the system SHALL include a filePath field in the LanceDB schema
2. WHEN records are stored THEN the system SHALL populate the filePath field with the absolute file path
3. WHEN querying records by file THEN the system SHALL use the filePath field for efficient filtering
4. IF the existing database lacks the filePath field THEN the system SHALL recreate the database with the new schema

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the reconciliation process to be performant and atomic, so that file saves remain responsive and data integrity is maintained even during concurrent operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reconciliation occurs THEN the system SHALL complete the delete-then-upsert cycle as a single logical operation
2. WHEN multiple records need deletion THEN the system SHALL use batch operations with WHERE id IN (...) queries
3. WHEN the reconciliation process fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the previous consistent state
4. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL complete reconciliation within reasonable time limits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling during reconciliation, so that temporary failures don't corrupt the vector store or break the development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and continue with graceful degradation
2. WHEN deletion operations fail THEN the system SHALL not proceed with upsert operations to avoid partial state
3. WHEN the vector store is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue operations for retry or skip gracefully
4. WHEN schema migration is required THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about database recreation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the reconciliation logic to integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase architecture, so that the enhancement doesn't disrupt current functionality or require extensive refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing reconciliation THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing service layer architecture
2. WHEN updating the VectorStoreService THEN the system SHALL preserve existing method signatures where possible
3. WHEN modifying the file save handler THEN the system SHALL maintain the current error handling and logging patterns
4. WHEN the feature is deployed THEN existing functionality SHALL continue to work without regression
