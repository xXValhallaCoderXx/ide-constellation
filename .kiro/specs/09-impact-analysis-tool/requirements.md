# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Impact Analysis Tool addresses a critical developer pain point: understanding the "blast radius" of code changes. When developers modify files without knowing their dependents, they risk introducing unforeseen bugs and breakages. This feature creates an MCP tool that provides detailed impact reports, showing all potentially affected files (dependents) and dependencies for any given file. This empowers developers to make informed decisions, reduce risks, and understand the ripple effects of their work before committing changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Kiro AI Agent, I want to call the constellation_impact_analysis tool with a file path, so that I can provide a developer with a detailed "blast radius" report for a proposed change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent calls constellation_impact_analysis with a valid file path THEN the system SHALL return a structured JSON response containing impact analysis data
2. WHEN the agent provides an invalid file path THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message with suggestions for similar file paths if available
3. WHEN the analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL complete the analysis within 5 seconds for typical codebases
4. WHEN a file path doesn't exist exactly THEN the system SHALL attempt fuzzy matching and suggest closest matches
5. WHEN path normalization is needed THEN the system SHALL handle relative paths, absolute paths, and workspace-relative paths consistently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ask Kiro to analyze the impact of changing a specific file, so that I can understand which other parts of the codebase might break or need updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request impact analysis for a file THEN the system SHALL provide a human-readable summary of potential impacts
2. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the number of affected files
3. WHEN multiple files depend on the target file THEN the system SHALL list all dependent files with their workspace-relative paths

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a list of all files that depend on a specific file (dependents), so that I can manually review the affected areas and plan for testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I analyze a file THEN the system SHALL return an array of all direct dependent file paths
2. WHEN a file has no dependents THEN the system SHALL return an empty array for dependents
3. WHEN dependents exist THEN each dependent SHALL be represented by its workspace-relative path

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a list of all files that a specific file depends on (dependencies), so that I can understand the external modules and internal files my component relies on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I analyze a file THEN the system SHALL return an array of all direct dependency file paths
2. WHEN a file has no dependencies THEN the system SHALL return an empty array for dependencies
3. WHEN dependencies exist THEN each dependency SHALL be represented by its workspace-relative path

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Kiro AI Agent, I want to receive a structured JSON response with dependents, dependencies, and a summary, so that I can clearly and accurately present the impact analysis to the developer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis completes THEN the system SHALL return a JSON object with impactSummary, dependents, dependencies, and impactGraph fields
2. WHEN the response is generated THEN the impactSummary SHALL be a human-readable string describing the analysis results
3. WHEN the response includes an impactGraph THEN it SHALL contain only the target file, its direct dependents, and direct dependencies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the impact analysis tool to integrate seamlessly with the existing MCP server infrastructure, so that it can be called reliably by AI agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN the constellation_impact_analysis tool SHALL be registered and available
2. WHEN the tool is called THEN it SHALL validate the filePath parameter as required
3. WHEN the tool accepts a changeType parameter THEN it SHALL be optional and stored for future use
4. WHEN the graph data is needed THEN the system SHALL use cached data when available or trigger a fresh scan if necessary

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the impact analysis to leverage existing graph infrastructure, so that the analysis is fast and consistent with other constellation features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing impact analysis THEN the system SHALL use the GraphService's reverse-dependency index for efficient lookups
2. WHEN finding dependencies THEN the system SHALL parse the existing graph's edges rather than re-scanning files
3. WHEN the graph is not available THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger a project scan before analysis

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust path handling and error recovery, so that the tool works reliably even with imperfect file path inputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file path contains path separators inconsistent with the OS THEN the system SHALL normalize the path automatically
2. WHEN a file path is not found in the graph THEN the system SHALL attempt fuzzy matching against known files
3. WHEN fuzzy matching finds potential matches THEN the system SHALL return suggestions with confidence scores
4. WHEN no matches are found THEN the system SHALL provide a helpful error message indicating the file is not in the analyzed codebase
5. WHEN path resolution fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and provide partial analysis if possible
