# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Core Visual Canvas feature transforms static dependency graph data into a fully interactive and performant visualization within the main VS Code webview panel. This creates the foundational "living map" that allows developers to visually explore their codebase structure and dependencies, serving as the base layer for future AI-driven features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visual Graph Representation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a visual representation of my codebase's dependency graph, so that I can understand its structure and complexity at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the graph data is loaded THEN the system SHALL render nodes representing code files and edges representing dependencies using Cytoscape.js
2. WHEN the graph is first displayed THEN the system SHALL apply a default layout algorithm (Cose or Dagre) to arrange nodes and edges in a readable format
3. WHEN the graph contains multiple files THEN the system SHALL display each file as a distinct node with appropriate labeling

### Requirement 2: Interactive Navigation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to smoothly pan and zoom around the graph, so that I can explore large codebases without lag or frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click and drag on the canvas THEN the system SHALL pan the view smoothly in the direction of the drag
2. WHEN I use the mouse scroll wheel THEN the system SHALL zoom in or out of the graph centered on the cursor position
3. WHEN performing pan and zoom operations THEN the system SHALL maintain 60 FPS performance
4. WHEN I interact with the canvas THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback without noticeable delay

### Requirement 3: Real-time Search Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search for a specific file on the graph, so that I can quickly locate any component I'm interested in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the canvas is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a text input field for search queries
2. WHEN I type in the search field THEN the system SHALL highlight or filter nodes whose labels match the query in real-time
3. WHEN search results are found THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish matching nodes from non-matching nodes
4. WHEN the search field is cleared THEN the system SHALL restore the normal appearance of all nodes

### Requirement 4: Data Communication and Loading

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the graph to load quickly and reliably, so that I can start exploring my codebase without waiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview panel mounts THEN the system SHALL post a graph:request message to the extension host
2. WHEN the extension host receives a graph:request THEN the system SHALL respond with a graph:response message containing the graph JSON data
3. WHEN the webview receives graph:response data THEN the system SHALL parse the nodes and edges and render them using Cytoscape.js
4. WHEN executing the showGraph command THEN the system SHALL complete the entire warm-load process and display a fully rendered, interactive graph in under 2 seconds

### Requirement 5: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the visual canvas to be responsive and performant, so that I can work with large codebases without experiencing lag or delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the graph contains a large number of nodes THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth interaction performance
2. WHEN rendering the initial graph THEN the system SHALL complete the rendering process without blocking the UI
3. WHEN performing any user interaction THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms to maintain perceived responsiveness
4. WHEN the graph is displayed THEN the system SHALL use efficient memory management to prevent performance degradation over time
