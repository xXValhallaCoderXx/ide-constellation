  - Add component state management for loading, error, and ready states
  - Implement proper cleanup and disposal of Cytoscape instance on unmount
  - Configure basic Cytoscape.js styling using VS Code CSS variables
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1_

- [x] 5. Implement pan and zoom interactions
  - Configure Cytoscape.js pan and zoom settings for smooth 60 FPS performance
  - Set appropriate zoom limits (minZoom: 0.1, maxZoom: 3.0) and wheel sensitivity
  - Implement viewport-based performance optimizations for large graphs
  - Add smooth animation transitions for zoom and pan operations
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 6. Create SearchBox component with real-time filtering
  - Implement SearchBox component with debounced input handling (300ms delay)
  - Create search index generation from graph nodes for efficient querying
  - Implement real-time node highlighting based on search query matches
  - Add search result count display and clear search functionality
  - _Requirements: 3.3_

- [x] 7. Integrate search functionality with GraphCanvas
  - Connect SearchBox component to GraphCanvas for coordinated highlighting
  - Implement node filtering and highlighting logic in Cytoscape.js
  - Add CSS classes and styles for highlighted/filtered node states
  - Ensure search highlighting updates smoothly without performance impact
  - _Requirements: 3.3_

- [x] 8. Extend WebviewManager to handle graph requests
  - Add handleGraphRequest method to WebviewManager class
  - Implement graph data retrieval using existing GraphService.getInstance()
  - Add proper error handling for graph loading failures with user-friendly messages
  - Ensure graph data is sent to webview in correct message format
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 9. Update ConstellationPanel to use GraphCanvas
  - Replace existing status-checking UI with GraphCanvas component
  - Implement graph data request on component mount
  - Add loading states and error handling for graph data retrieval
  - Integrate SearchBox component into the panel layout
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 10. Implement layout algorithm configuration
  - Configure Cose layout algorithm with appropriate settings for readability
  - Add layout animation with 1-second duration and proper fit/padding settings
  - Implement layout caching to avoid recalculation on re-renders
  - Add fallback layout options for performance-constrained scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 5.4_

- [x] 11. Add performance monitoring and optimization
  - Implement performance metrics tracking for load times and interaction responsiveness
  - Add memory usage monitoring and cleanup for large graph scenarios
  - Implement graph sampling for very large codebases (1000+ nodes)
  - Add performance warnings and graceful degradation for resource-constrained environments
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 12. Integrate with VS Code theming and styling
  - Apply VS Code CSS variables throughout Cytoscape.js styling configuration
  - Ensure proper contrast and accessibility compliance with VS Code themes
  - Add responsive design considerations for different panel sizes
  - Implement consistent styling with existing VS Code extension patterns
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1_
