# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements structural indexing on file save, which automatically parses saved TypeScript/JavaScript files to extract structural metadata (functions, classes, interfaces, and their JSDoc comments) and maintains this information in a centralized manifest.json file. This creates a searchable index of code symbols across the workspace that can be used for code navigation, documentation generation, and intelligent code assistance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my code structure to be automatically indexed when I save files, so that I can quickly navigate and understand my codebase without manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a TypeScript or JavaScript file is saved THEN the system SHALL parse the file content and extract structural metadata
2. WHEN parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL update the manifest.json file with the extracted symbols
3. WHEN a file is saved multiple times THEN the system SHALL replace the previous index data for that file with the new data
4. IF parsing fails for any reason THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue without crashing the extension

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want function and class metadata to be extracted with their JSDoc comments, so that I can maintain documentation context alongside structural information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function declaration is encountered THEN the system SHALL extract the function name, parameters, return type, and associated JSDoc comment
2. WHEN a class declaration is encountered THEN the system SHALL extract the class name, methods, properties, and associated JSDoc comments
3. WHEN an interface or type declaration is encountered THEN the system SHALL extract the name, properties, and associated JSDoc comments
4. WHEN a symbol has no JSDoc comment THEN the system SHALL still index the symbol with empty documentation fields

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the structural index to be stored in a centralized manifest file, so that other tools and features can access this information efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN structural data is extracted THEN the system SHALL store it in /.constellation/manifest.json
2. WHEN the manifest file doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create the /.constellation directory and manifest.json file
3. WHEN updating the manifest THEN the system SHALL preserve existing data for other files while updating only the current file's data
4. WHEN writing to the manifest THEN the system SHALL format the JSON with proper indentation for readability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the parsing to handle TypeScript and JavaScript syntax correctly, so that all my project files can be indexed regardless of language variant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a .ts file is saved THEN the system SHALL parse it using TypeScript syntax rules
2. WHEN a .js file is saved THEN the system SHALL parse it using JavaScript syntax rules
3. WHEN a .tsx or .jsx file is saved THEN the system SHALL parse it with JSX support enabled
4. IF a file contains syntax errors THEN the system SHALL log the error and skip indexing that file

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the indexing process to be performant and non-blocking, so that file saving remains responsive even for large files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is being parsed THEN the system SHALL not block the file save operation
2. WHEN parsing large files THEN the system SHALL complete within a reasonable time limit
3. WHEN multiple files are saved rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent parsing requests gracefully
4. IF parsing takes too long THEN the system SHALL timeout and log a warning

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want location information for each symbol, so that I can navigate directly to the code when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting a symbol THEN the system SHALL record its line number and column position
2. WHEN extracting a symbol THEN the system SHALL record the file path relative to the workspace root
3. WHEN a symbol spans multiple lines THEN the system SHALL record both start and end positions
4. WHEN storing location data THEN the system SHALL use a consistent format that can be used for navigation
