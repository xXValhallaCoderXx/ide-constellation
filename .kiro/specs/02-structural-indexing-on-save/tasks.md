  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 2.2 Implement AST parsing and traversal logic
  - Implement parseCode method using @babel/parser to generate AST from code string

  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 2.3 Implement JSDoc comment extraction
  - Implement extractJSDoc method to extract JSDoc comments from AST nodes
  - Handle cases where symbols have no JSDoc comments by returning undefined

  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 2.4 Add error handling and logging for parsing failures
  - Implement try-catch blocks around parsing operations to handle syntax errors
  - Add logging for parsing failures without crashing the extension
  - Handle timeout scenarios for large files
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.4, 5.4_

- [ ] 3. Implement manifest file management service
- [ ] 3.1 Create ManifestService class structure
  - Create src/services/ManifestService.ts file with class definition and method signatures
  - Implement ensureDirectoryExists method to create .constellation directory if needed
  - Define manifest file path as /.constellation/manifest.json
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 3.2 Implement manifest file reading functionality
  - Implement readManifest method to safely read existing manifest.json file
  - Handle cases where manifest file doesn't exist by returning empty Manifest object
  - Parse JSON content and validate structure
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 3.3 Implement manifest file writing functionality
  - Implement writeManifest method to serialize Manifest object to formatted JSON
  - Ensure proper JSON indentation for readability
  - Handle file system errors gracefully with appropriate logging
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 3.4 Implement file-specific symbol updating
  - Implement updateFileSymbols method to update symbols for a specific file path
  - Preserve existing data for other files while updating only current file's data
  - Update lastUpdated timestamp when making changes
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.3_

- [ ] 4. Integrate parsing services with existing file save handler
- [ ] 4.1 Modify contentProcessor to use CodeParserService
  - Update processDocument function in src/contentProcessor.ts to call CodeParserService
  - Extract file content, file path, and file extension from vscode.TextDocument
  - Call CodeParserService.parseCode with extracted information
  - Add error handling to ensure parsing failures don't crash the extension
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [ ] 4.2 Integrate ManifestService with document processing
  - Update processDocument function to call ManifestService.updateFileSymbols
  - Pass extracted symbols from CodeParserService to ManifestService
  - Ensure manifest updates happen after successful parsing
  - Add error handling for manifest update failures
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 4.3 Implement asynchronous processing to avoid blocking file saves
  - Convert processDocument function to async/await pattern
  - Ensure file save operations remain responsive during parsing
  - Handle concurrent file save events gracefully
  - Add logging to track processing performance
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 5. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] 5.1 Implement error boundaries in file save event handler
  - Update handleDocumentSave function to catch and log all parsing-related errors
  - Ensure extension stability by preventing any parsing errors from crashing the extension
  - Add fallback logging when document information cannot be accessed
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.4_

- [ ] 5.2 Add performance monitoring and timeout handling
  - Implement timeout mechanism for parsing operations to prevent blocking
  - Add performance logging to track parsing duration for different file sizes
  - Log warnings when parsing takes longer than expected
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.4_

- [ ] 6. Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] 6.1 Write unit tests for CodeParserService
  - Test parsing of functions with different parameter types and return types
  - Test parsing of classes with methods, properties, and inheritance
  - Test parsing of interfaces and type declarations
  - Test JSDoc extraction for various comment formats
  - Test error handling with malformed code
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 6.2 Write unit tests for ManifestService
  - Test reading existing manifest files with various structures
  - Test creating new manifest files when none exist
  - Test updating specific file entries while preserving others
  - Test directory creation and file system error handling
