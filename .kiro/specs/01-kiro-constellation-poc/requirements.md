# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Kiro Constellation POC is a proof of concept VS Code extension designed to validate three critical architectural pillars: VS Code extension activation with side panel UI, silent background MCP server management, and Kiro agent communication with the local server. This POC establishes the foundational infrastructure for future context-aware features by creating a communication bridge between VS Code, a local MCP server, and Kiro agents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: VS Code Extension Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access Kiro Constellation through VS Code's command palette, so that I can easily launch the constellation panel when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is installed THEN the system SHALL contribute a command "Kiro Constellation: Show Panel" to the VS Code command palette
2. WHEN the extension activates THEN the system SHALL automatically initialize and start the MCP Server service
3. WHEN the extension deactivates THEN the system SHALL gracefully shut down the MCP Server
4. WHEN VS Code closes THEN the system SHALL ensure all background processes are properly terminated

### Requirement 2: Webview Side Panel Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a dedicated side panel for Kiro Constellation, so that I can interact with the constellation features within my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the "Show Panel" command is executed THEN the system SHALL open a VS Code webview panel titled "Kiro Constellation"
2. WHEN the webview panel opens THEN the system SHALL display a static title "Kiro Constellation POC"
3. WHEN the webview panel opens THEN the system SHALL show a status indicator text field initially displaying "Status: Unknown"
4. WHEN the webview panel opens THEN the system SHALL provide a button labeled "Check Server Status"
5. WHEN the "Check Server Status" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL trigger a request from the webview to the extension backend
6. WHEN the backend receives the status request THEN the system SHALL query the MCP server's /status endpoint and display the result in the status indicator

### Requirement 3: MCP Server Management

**User Story:** As a system component, I want to run a local MCP server in the background, so that Kiro agents can communicate with the VS Code extension through a standardized interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension activates THEN the system SHALL start an Express.js server on port 31337
2. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN the system SHALL expose a GET endpoint at /status
3. WHEN a GET request is made to /status THEN the system SHALL return a 200 OK response
4. WHEN a successful /status request occurs THEN the system SHALL return JSON with format: `{ "status": "ok", "timestamp": "ISO_DATE_STRING" }`
5. WHEN the extension deactivates THEN the system SHALL properly shut down the Express.js server
6. IF the server fails to start THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4: Build System and UI Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the webview UI to be built with modern tooling, so that the codebase is maintainable and the build process is efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the webview UI THEN the system SHALL use the Preact framework for component rendering
2. WHEN compiling the UI code THEN the system SHALL use esbuild to process Preact JSX and TypeScript
3. WHEN the build process completes THEN the system SHALL generate a single JavaScript bundle for webview consumption
4. WHEN the webview loads THEN the system SHALL successfully render the Preact components
5. IF build errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the developer

### Requirement 5: Kiro Agent Integration Validation

**User Story:** As a Kiro agent, I want to successfully communicate with the local MCP server, so that I can validate the foundational architecture for context-aware features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Kiro command or hook is executed THEN the system SHALL be able to query the /status endpoint
2. WHEN the Kiro agent queries the /status endpoint THEN the system SHALL return a successful response
3. WHEN the communication test completes THEN the system SHALL confirm that Kiro can access the local server
4. IF the communication fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information about the failure
