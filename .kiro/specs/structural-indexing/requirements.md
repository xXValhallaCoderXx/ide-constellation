# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The structural indexing feature creates a persistent "Code Manifest" that serves as a fast, queryable index of all key code symbols (functions, classes, methods, variables) within a VS Code workspace. This manifest acts as the first layer of a Project Memory Engine, capturing the architectural "what" and "where" of the codebase by listening to file-save events, parsing code into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), and maintaining an up-to-date index of code symbols.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically index my code symbols when I save files, so that I have a persistent, queryable record of my codebase structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a TypeScript file is saved THEN the system SHALL parse the file content and extract code symbols
2. WHEN code symbols are extracted THEN the system SHALL store them in a manifest.json file at [workspaceRoot]/.constellation/manifest.json
3. WHEN the manifest.json file doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically
4. WHEN a file is saved multiple times THEN the system SHALL update only that file's symbols without affecting other files' entries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive symbol information captured, so that I can understand the structure and location of code elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing a file THEN the system SHALL extract functions, classes, methods, and variables
2. WHEN extracting symbols THEN the system SHALL capture the symbol name, type, file path, and position information
3. WHEN a symbol has documentation THEN the system SHALL extract and store JSDoc or docstring comments
4. WHEN generating symbol IDs THEN the system SHALL create unique identifiers in the format "filePath#symbolName"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the indexing to be selective and performant, so that it doesn't slow down my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a non-target file is saved THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger the indexing process
2. WHEN target files include TypeScript files THEN the system SHALL process .ts files
3. WHEN the indexing process runs THEN the system SHALL complete without noticeable editor lag
4. WHEN files are saved THEN the system SHALL only process the changed file, not the entire workspace

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the manifest data to be structured and accessible, so that other tools can query and use the indexed information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing the manifest THEN the system SHALL use JSON format with file paths as keys
2. WHEN organizing symbol data THEN the system SHALL group symbols by their source file
3. WHEN storing position information THEN the system SHALL include start and end line/character positions
4. WHEN the manifest is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain valid JSON structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling, so that file system issues don't break the indexing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file read operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing
2. WHEN directory creation is needed THEN the system SHALL create the .constellation directory if it doesn't exist
3. WHEN parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue operation
4. WHEN write operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors without corrupting existing data
