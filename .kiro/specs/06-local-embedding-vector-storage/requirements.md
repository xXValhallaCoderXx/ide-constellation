# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements local embedding generation and vector storage capabilities to create a searchable semantic index of the codebase. The system will extract docstrings from code files, convert them to vector embeddings using a local transformer model, and store them in a LanceDB vector database. This foundation enables semantic search and retrieval of code documentation based on natural language queries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically generate vector embeddings from code docstrings when I save files, so that my code documentation becomes semantically searchable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is saved THEN the system SHALL extract all docstrings from the file
2. WHEN docstrings are extracted THEN the system SHALL generate vector embeddings using a local transformer model
3. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store them in a local vector database with unique identifiers
4. WHEN the embedding process completes THEN the system SHALL log confirmation messages for debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the embedding service to use a local AI model, so that I don't depend on external APIs and can work offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension activates THEN the system SHALL initialize a local sentence-transformer model
2. WHEN the model is loaded THEN the system SHALL use a singleton pattern to ensure one-time initialization
3. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the system SHALL use the @xenova/transformers library with a pre-trained model
4. WHEN the model fails to load THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want embeddings stored in a persistent vector database, so that semantic search results remain available across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension activates THEN the system SHALL connect to a LanceDB database at /.constellation/vector-store
2. WHEN connecting to the database THEN the system SHALL create an embeddings table if it doesn't exist
3. WHEN storing embeddings THEN the system SHALL use a schema with id, text, and vector fields
4. WHEN upserting data THEN the system SHALL use file path and symbol name as unique identifiers
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test vector search functionality, so that I can verify embeddings are stored correctly and searchable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute a debug command THEN the system SHALL perform a similarity search using a test query
2. WHEN performing similarity search THEN the system SHALL convert the query to a vector embedding
3. WHEN searching the vector database THEN the system SHALL return the most similar stored docstrings
4. WHEN search results are found THEN the system SHALL display them in the debug console
5. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL handle the empty result case appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle large codebases efficiently, so that file save operations remain responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple docstrings THEN the system SHALL handle them asynchronously
2. WHEN the embedding model is busy THEN the system SHALL queue requests appropriately
3. WHEN database operations are slow THEN the system SHALL not block the UI thread
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL manage resources efficiently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues with the embedding system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error messages
2. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error feedback
3. WHEN embedding generation fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and continue processing other docstrings
4. WHEN vector storage fails THEN the system SHALL log the error with context information
